# FSToken

## Overview

FSToken (FST) is an ERC20-compliant token designed for the fashion industry. This smart contract facilitates the creation, management, and distribution of tokens within the fashion ecosystem. It adheres to the ERC20 standard and includes features for minting and burning tokens, offering a flexible solution for managing digital assets.

## Features

- **ERC20 Compliance:** Fully compliant with the ERC20 token standard.
- **Minting:** Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens.
- **Burning:** Enables token holders to burn their own tokens.
- **Customizable Transfers:** Provides the option to add custom logic before and after token transfers.
- **Decimals Support:** Configurable decimal places to manage fractional values.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Remix IDE**: Use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) for compiling and deploying the smart contract.
- Basic understanding of Solidity and Ethereum smart contracts.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Open Remix IDE**: Access [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) in your web browser.
2. **Create a New File**: In the File Explorer, create a new file named `FashionShowToken.sol`.
3. **Add Contract Code**: Copy and paste the contents of `FashionShowToken.sol` into the new file in Remix.
4. **Compile the Contract**: Use the Solidity compiler in Remix to compile the contract. Ensure there are no errors or warnings.
5. **Deploy the Contract**: 
   - Navigate to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
   - Choose the appropriate environment (e.g., JavaScript VM, Injected Web3, or Web3 Provider).
   - Deploy the contract and provide the `initialOwner` address when prompted.

## Contract Functions

- **mint(address to, uint256 amount)**: Mints `amount` of tokens to the specified `to` address. Only callable by the owner.
- **burn(uint256 amount)**: Burns `amount` of tokens from the caller's address.
- **transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)**: Transfers `amount` of tokens to the `recipient` address.
- **transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)**: Transfers `amount` of tokens from `sender` to `recipient` on behalf of the sender.

### Example Usage

Here are examples of how to interact with the contract using web3.js:

```javascript
// Minting tokens to a specific address
await fashionShowToken.mint('0xRecipientAddress', web3.utils.toWei('10', 'ether'));

// Burning tokens from the caller's address
await fashionShowToken.burn(web3.utils.toWei('5', 'ether'));

// Transferring tokens
await fashionShowToken.transfer('0xRecipientAddress', web3.utils.toWei('2', 'ether'));

// Transferring tokens from another address
await fashionShowToken.transferFrom('0xSenderAddress', '0xRecipientAddress', web3.utils.toWei('3', 'ether'));
```

## Security Considerations

- **Testing**: Thoroughly test the contract on testnets (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten) before deploying to the Ethereum mainnet.
- **Audits**: Consider having the smart contract audited to identify and mitigate potential security issues.
- **Gas Costs**: Be aware of gas costs associated with minting, burning, and transferring tokens. Optimize code where possible to reduce costs.
